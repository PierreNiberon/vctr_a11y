How to use the RGAA
The RGAA applies to any HTML content (HTML4, XHTML1, HTML5). For some tests, a reference baseline is used. This baseline takes into account a set of assistive technologies, browsers and operating systems, on which the accessibility of JavaScript-based interface components must be tested, among others. A detailed description is provided here: Baseline.

Important notice regarding HTML content prior to HTML5 specification
When the HTML code of the page is not HTML5, the HTML5 elements (tags and attributes) required by a criterion or test, are not applicable. Every other criteria or tests remain applicable, including those related to ARIA attributes, states or properties. The following criteria and tests are not applicable:

Criterion 1.10;
Criterion 9.2;
Test 11.10.1 (condition 2, relative to the HTML5 attribute required).
Validation process
For each criterion, compliance is defined as follows:

Conforming (C): all applicable tests are passed
Non Conforming (NC): at least one applicable test is failed
Not Applicable (NA): there is no content targeted by the criterion.
The RGAA proposes two additional compliance statuses:

Derogated (D): some contents targeted by the criterion will meet compliance by derogation
Not tested (NT): the criterion has not been tested.
You can get further information about the RGAA validation process in the RGAA companion guide: How is RGAA conformance verified?
